BASIC SHELL COMMANDS
1. In which directory are you when you open a new terminal?
/home/jovyan
#this is the home directory of the user
With which Unix-command do you find out the directory you are currently in? 
pwd
2. How do you find out which Linux-shell you are working with?
echo "$SHELL"
3. How would you launch the text-editor emacs in a way that you can continue to use your shell while the emacs is running?
emacs me.txt & 
#to launch emacs in the background
fg %job-ID - to move emacs to foreground
4. Launch your favorite text-editor (not necessarily emacs) and create a file me.txt containing your name.
vim me.txt
5. After finishing the file me.txt and closing your editor: Create a new subdirectory test1 in your home directory.
mkdir test1
6. Copy the file me.txt into the subdirectory as me_copy.txt.
cp me.txt test1/me_copy.txt
7. Does your copy-operation from the previous-command use a relative or an absolute path for the target-directory?
#Our command uses relative path. Absolute path would be /home/jovyan/me.txt and /home/jovyan/test1/me_copy.txt
8. Use the cd-command to move between your home-directory and the subdiretory.
cd test1
9. Rename the copy me_copy.txt to me_renames.txt while being in your home-directory.
mv test1/me_copy.txt test1/me_renames.txt
10. Using echo and a redirection of the standard output, add your date of birth at the end of the copy me_copy.txt.
echo 01.01.2000 >> /home/jovyan/test1/me_copy.txt
11. Use the diff-command to compare the two files me.txt and me_copy.txt. If you did not yet use the diff-command, then look it up on the internet.
diff me.txt test1/me_renames.txt
12. Use the ls-command (with appropriate options) to show me.txt and me_copy.txt together with their file sizes. Can you tell why the file-size difference is what it is?
ls -lh me.txt test1/me_copy.txt
#The file sizes are different since me.txt is empty, whereas me_copy.txt is not empty.
13. Except for our Online-system, your Uni-ID credentials are also valid for the computers within the Physics computer pool (CIP-pool). The name of the CIP-pool machine you can login is cip-pool.physik.uni-bonn.de. Use the ssh-command to login into that machine. On the CIP-pool machine, create a subdirectory python_course and logout from the machine again. 
ssh cip-pool-physik.uni-bonn.de
mkdir python_course
exit
14. Use the command scp to copy the files me.txt and me_copy.txt into the python_course-subdirectory on the CIP-pool machine.
scp me.txt s6ajsakt@cip-pool.physik.uni-bonn.de:/home/s6ajsakt/physik/python_course/
scp test1/me_copy.txt s6ajsakt@cip-pool.physik.uni-bonn.de:/home/s6ajsakt/physik/python_course/
#replace s6ajsakt with $USER (user name)
15. Delete the subdirectory test1 and the copy of me.txt in it. Can you do this with a single command?
rm -rf test1
16. Put two copies of me.txt (choose your own file names) into a new subdirectory test2. Use the tar-command to backup that directory to test2.tar.gz
cp me.txt test2/me_copy1.txt
cp me.txt test2/me_copy2.txt
tar -cvf test2.tar.gz -C test2 .
Note: Use -cvzf to compress
17. Use tar to restore the contents of test2.tar.gz into a sub-directory test3
mkdir test3 && tar -xvf test2.tar.gz -C test3
