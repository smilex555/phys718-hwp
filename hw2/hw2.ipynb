    "The student Lydia Leibnitz proposes the following algorithm for the task:\n",
    "1. We are given a natural number $n$ that we want to test\n",
    "2. In a loop, we test whether `n % m == 0` for all natural numbers $m$ with $2\\leq m < \\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "3. If the test (2) is `True` for any of the tested $m$, then $n$ is not prime. Otherwise, we have a prime number.\n",

Similarily, we conclude that not both, $a$ and $b$ can be larger than $\\sqrt{n}$. It follows that one of the divisors of $n$ must be smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ and we only need to test $2\\leq m < \\sqrt{n}$ to check whether $n$ is a prime.\n",

    "Mc Donalds sells its Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 and 20 pieces. Write a ```python``` program which tests for a given number `N` whether `N` nuggets can be bought or not. Your program should print *all* possible package combinations in which the `N` nuggets can be obtained (e.g. 60 nuggets can be bought with 3 packages of 20 pieces, 10 packages of 6 pieces and three more combinations). Print a corresponding message if the `N` nuggets cannot be bought! \n",

One possible approach is as follows: Write three nested `while` loops iterating over the variables `m`, `n` and `o`. The variables represent the number of packages with corresponding pieces. `m` stands for the number of packages with 6 nuggets and so on. Within the innermost loop, you can check with an `if`-statement such as\n",
