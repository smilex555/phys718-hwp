    "**Remarks:**  \n",
    "It should be noted that the above code checks every word for an exact match. For example, the words, \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are considered different. In other words the code is case sensitive, when it comes to repetitions of characters. This is much more difficult to overcome since ASCII encodes different cases differently. While it is possible to check letters for cases, it is much more involved. We do not try that since it is not a part of the problem. This \"failure\" is actually a boon, since legitimated sentences like \" ... here. Here, ...\" will not be marked as a repetition, but genuine mistakes will go unmarked. This example shows us the complexity of this case.  \n",
    "It should also be noted that the above code will fail when you have a special character sandwiched between two same words, for example, \"hello-hello\" (or even something like, \"hello . hello\"). This will return a repetition. Such cases are actually fairly common in English, and again, it is possible to check for this case separately. This has not been done here, but could be a part of a future \"update\" to this code.  \n",
    "To summarise, the code essentially checks for word repetitions at consecutive positions and at the end and the beginning of consecutive lines. While it is true that it returns false repetitions (in certain cases), it obviously does not neglect true repetitions (within the constraint of case sensitivity)."
