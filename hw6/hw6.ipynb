    "In October 2012, Felix Baumgartner broke the world record of skydiving at that time, by jumping from an altitude of 39 km and reaching a maximum speed of 1357 km/h. In this problem you will calculate Baumgartner's trajectory by solving numerically the free fall equation, taking into account the varying air density and the varying drag coefficient. We will have to make some simplifying assumptions which will prevent us from reproducing the exact characteristics of his jump, but we will get a good idea of what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise we will look at a one-dimensional free fall case with a drag term that is proportional to velocity square. This is realistic for high speed situations. The equation of motion is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m\\ddot{z}=mg-\\frac 12 \\rho(z)C_D(z)A(t)\\dot{z}^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $z$ is Baumgartners space-coordinate with $z=0$ at the surface of the Earth. His jump starts at $z_0=39$ km.\n",

    "the drag coefficient and $A(t)$ the jumper’s cross-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baumgartners jump has two phases:\n",
    "1. Phase 1 is the free-fall with the parachute closed. Phase 1 starts at $z_0=39$ km and ens at about $z_P\\approx 2$ km. Additional parameters of tis phase are: $g=9.8$ ms$^{-2}$ (we assume this as constant!), $m=118$ kg, $C_D(z)=0.3$ and $A(t)=0.9$ m$²$. The air density depends on the space-coordinate $z$ via $\\rho(z) = 1.22\\exp(-\\frac z{10\\text{ km}})$ kg m$^{-3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Phase 2 starts when the parachute is opened at $z_P\\approx 2$ km. The parameters of that phase of the jump are: $g=9.8$ ms$^{-2}$, $m=118$ kg, $C_D(z)=1.5$ and $\\rho(z)=1.22$ kg m$^{-3}$ (const). The crosssection $A(t)$ is now determined by the parachute and we must take into account that it takes some seconds to open it completely. We model this by:\n",

    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "1. Implement Felixs drop in a script with name `skydive_group_X.py` and create plots of the jump for $z(t)$ and $\\dot{z}(t)$. The initial conditions are $z(0)=z_0=39$ km and $\\dot{z}(0)=0$ m/s. The jump ends at $z(t_e)=0$ m.\n",
    "2. Answer within a textfile `skydive_group_X.txt` the following questions:\n",
    "  1. What is the maximal (absolute) velocity that Felix reaches with our model?\n",
    "  2. What is his speed when he reaches the surface of the Earth?\n",
    "  3. How long did the complete jump last?\n",
    "  4. Why does Felixs speed at the start of the jump raise quickly but slows down already before he opens his parachute?\n",

    "**Hints**: (1) You need to solve *two* differential equations. One for phase 1 ($0\\leq t\\leq t_F$) of the jump and the other one for phase 2 ($t_F<t\\leq t_e$). The solution of the equation for phase 1 at $z(t_P)$ determines the initial conditions for the ODE of phase2!; (2) For the final plots you need to *combine* the two solutions; (3) Test your pogram by checking your solution for plausibility. The jump should not last for hours and nobody survives a crash on the Earth with $v=100$ m/s etc."
