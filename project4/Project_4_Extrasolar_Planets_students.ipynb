    "**Imprtant:** You again have the choice between two projects. This one focusses on an advanced scientific problem from astronomy (detection and analysis of extrasolar planets). It teaches modern analysis techniques, advanced statistical techniques  and it is based on real observations. The other project focusses on the implementation and analysis of a more complex system of differential equations. You will also learn how to create animations woth matplotlib."

    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignments, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We hand-out four projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The project needs to be submitted by uploading this notebook to [Projects/Project 4](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_2645968.html) on eCampus. You do not need to modify the notebooks name before your upload. Your project must be on eCampus by Monday, 04.07.2022, 23:55. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tutors, Nina and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    "In this problem set, we are going to investigate a dataset that contains the *radial velocity* of a star at various points in time. The radial velocity is the velocity with which the star is moving towards or away from us (positive velocities indicate it is moving away from us).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a star is not close to any other objects, there is no reason why the radial velocity should change over time. However, in the case where a second object is orbiting a star (such as a planet or another star), the star and the object will both orbit the center of mass of the two-body system. Therefore, the star will show periodic variations in its velocity over time. These changes in velocity then cause a shift in spectral lines via the Doppler effect, which we can measure with telescopes that have state-of-the art spectrographs. The smaller the second object, the less the star will be affected. For example, the Earth causes the Sun to change its velocity with an amplitude of 0.1 m/s over 1 year.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the following video to see an example of a large planet orbiting a star and the effect on the observed spectral lines of the star:"
